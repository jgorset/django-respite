Installation and configuration
==============================

Respite is best installed with `pip`_::

    $ pip install django-respite
    
.. _configuration:

Configuration
-------------

In your ``settings`` module:

* Add ``respite`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``
* Add ``respite.middleware.HttpPutMiddleware`` to ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``
* Add ``respite.middleware.HttpPatchMiddleware`` to ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``
* Add ``respite.middleware.JsonMiddleware`` to ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``

If you're not just building an API, you might also want to add ``respite.middleware.HttpMethodOverrideMiddleware``
to your middleware classes; it facilitates for overriding the HTTP method with the ``X-HTTP-Method-Override`` header or a
``_method`` HTTP POST parameter, which is the only way to replace, update and delete resources from a web browser.

.. note::

    ``HttpMethodOverrideMiddleware`` must be processed before ``HttpPutMiddleware`` and ``HttpPatchMiddleware``.

.. note::

    If you are using respite with backbone.js or any other frameworks that uses jQuery.ajax to make requests to the
    server, you might want to add ``<script src="{{ STATIC_URL }}respite/js/jquery.respite.js"></script>`` to your 
    base template. This configures jQuery to be compliant with respite's way of handling ``Accept`` headers.
